# NeuralNetwork
This is a neural net written in Python from scratch with 1 hidden layer of 3 neurons trained to approximate f(x) = 2 * relu(-x + 1) -1.

This is not necessarily meant to be run. It's more of a proof of concept for myself to learn about the fundamentals of how neural networks work. That is why the only modules being used are to generate random numbers and plot the results of the neural network.

The report included in this repository discusses these details about the neural network.
