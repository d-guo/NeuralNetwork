# NeuralNetwork
This is a neural network written in Python from scratch with 1 hidden layer of 3 neurons trained to approximate the function f(x) = 2 * relu(-x + 1) -1.

## Use
To see training progress measured by the loss function, enter "python nn.py" in command line. \
To use the neural network for evaluating inputs, remove the comments in "nn.py". \
The code is not necessarily meant to be run. It's more of a demonstration of the backpropagation used in neural networks.

## Prerequisites
Python \
matplotlib

## Code Details
"nn.py" contains all the important code. \
Details about can be found in the report "Neural Network Report.pdf".

## Results
Results are talked about in depth in in the report.
