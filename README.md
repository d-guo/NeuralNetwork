# NeuralNetwork
This is a neural net made from scratch with 1 hidden layer of 3 neurons trained to approximate f(x) = 2 * relu(-x + 1) -1.
This is not necessarily meant to be run, as much as it is a proof of concept for myself to learn about the fundamentals of how neural networks work. That is why the only modules being used are to generate random numbers and plot the results of the neural network.
